# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Only the latest released version of `wasmcp` receives security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in `wasmcp`:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Please email: **security@wasmcp.org**  
   (If unavailable, contact the maintainers directly via GitHub.)

We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours, investigate promptly, and work
with you on a coordinated disclosure.

## Disclosure Process
- A private fix branch may be used to prepare a patch.  
- Once a fix is available, a security advisory will be published through the
  GitHub Advisory system, and a new release will be cut.  
- Credit will be given to reporters unless anonymity is requested.

Thank you for helping keep the project and its users safe.
