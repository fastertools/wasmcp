# Governance

The `wasmcp` project is an open source effort to define and implement the
WebAssembly Component Model binding for the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## Project Values
- **Neutrality** – the project is hosted under the `wasmcp` GitHub organization
  to make clear that it is bigger than any one company.
- **Openness** – design, discussion, and decision-making happen in public.
- **Interoperability** – specifications, WIT definitions, and reference
  implementations are portable across runtimes.

## Roles
- **Maintainers**  
  Responsible for approving PRs, cutting releases, and setting direction.
  Maintainers must demonstrate sustained contributions and uphold project values.
- **Contributors**  
  Anyone who opens issues, submits PRs, or improves docs. Contributors may
  propose features and fixes via the RFC process (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`).

## Decision Making
- Everyday technical decisions are made through the normal GitHub PR review
  process.  
- PRs require at least one maintainer approval before merging.  
- For larger changes (spec revisions, WIT breaking changes, governance changes),
  an RFC is required. Consensus among maintainers is sought; if consensus cannot
  be reached, a simple majority vote of maintainers decides.

## Adding and Removing Maintainers
- New maintainers are nominated by an existing maintainer and approved by
  majority vote.  
- Maintainers who are inactive for six months may be rotated to emeritus status
  by consensus of the active maintainers.  
- Any maintainer may step down voluntarily at any time.

## Meetings and Communication
- Most discussion takes place in GitHub issues and PRs.  
- Community syncs may be scheduled ad hoc if needed; notes will be published
  in-repo.  
- No private mailing list or backchannel is required to contribute.

## Future Evolution
As the project grows, governance may evolve to include a formal steering
committee or foundation affiliation (e.g., Bytecode Alliance incubation).
Changes to governance require an RFC and majority approval of maintainers.
