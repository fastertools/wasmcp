/// File system roots types for MCP (CLIENT CAPABILITY)
/// 
/// NOTE: This is a CLIENT capability - servers request roots, clients provide them.
/// Only type definitions are provided here, no function interfaces, as:
/// 1. No real MCP client implementations exist yet
/// 2. Client capability interfaces are likely to change in future MCP spec versions
/// 3. The exact client-side implementation patterns are still being established
///
/// These types enable protocol-compliant marshaling while avoiding premature
/// interface definitions for capabilities that don't have reference implementations.

/// Type definitions for roots
